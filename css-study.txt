- CSS => Cascading Style Sheets

1. Css types 
   
   - inline Css : include inline styles of Html tag. 
      - <h1 style="color: red">Text</h1>
  
   - internal Css : internal css places into the head tag with <style> tag and can style all of element included in this page.
     - <head>
        ....
        <style> h1 {color: red;} </style>
       </head>

    - external css : The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages.
      - <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/style.css"/> 
       </head>

    - By CSS : inline Css > internal Css > external Css



2. Css Syntax and

   - selector { property : value };
   - selectors using for class for ".", for id "#"
   - id > class > element tag
   - id can use only one time in the page, class can use multiple times
   - if we use two classes of one element, like <h1 class="heading italic">. As this code h1 tag gets two values of classes that css file
   - By the way when we use two id values of element, like <h1 id="heading italic" all of id values will deleted and gets default browser style value
   - ID selectors: ID selectors are the most specific kind of selector
      


3. By the default browser style values should set body margin to 0;


4. Interesting facts about height, width in css, Calculation of Height and Width

   /*****  height  *****/

   - The height Css property specifies the height of an element
   - If box-sizing is set to border-box it determines the height of the border area
   
   - Height Values :
     1. Length: px, em, vh -> absolute value 
     2. Percentage: 50%, 75% -> height as percentage
     3. Keyword: max-content, mint-content, fit-content(20em), auto
     4. Global values: inherit,initial, revert, unset

     5. Most used common values: px, em, vh and auto


   /*****  width   *****/

   - Sets an element's width
   - By default, it sets the width of the content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box, it sets the width of the border area.
   - Width Values :
     1. Length: px, em -> absolute value 
     2. Percentage: 50%, 75% -> height as percentage
     3. Keyword: max-content, mint-content, fit-content(20em), auto
     4. Global values: inherit,initial, revert, unset

     5. Most used common values: px, em, % and auto
    

    /**** Calculation  ****/

    - By default size such as height and width have same 200px size
    - When padding is set to 20px, this div height and width will be 240px
    - When border is set to 10px solid, div height and width will be 260px
    - When margin is set to 30px , this div height and width will be 320px
   


5. Display

   - Common block elements : p, headers ( h1 to h6), div, list tags ( ul, li, ol), form elements
   - Common inline elements : span, img, a tags
   - We can't set width and height with inline elements
   - Can set the height and width of the block elements
   - When we choose inline-block, can set inline elements with width and height

   - Different of display : none vs visibility: hidden
     * when we use display: none of any element, this element will deleted layout and next inline or block element will place instead of none element
     * By the way visibility: hidden is value that just hidden of element's position, next element can't take o place hidden element



6. Position

   - Relative position of the element can set top, bottom, left, right values
   - Relative position is relative to own position not viewport screen
   - Relative elements doesn't effect to any other elements

   - Absolute position is relative to parent.
       - There is a simple div element setting relative position, and inside has img element has absolute position.
       In this situation, element that absolute image place 30px of right, it will become 30px position on right not left of the screen.
   - Relative position is relative to own position not viewport screen but absolute position is relative to parent element, 
     when here no parent element it takes body

   - Relative and Absolute positions are pretty good to position of elements



7. font-size: 100% -> is equal font-size: 16px; 
   - Here is also funny information : font-size => 16px = 100% = 1em, so px just recommended to using than other values   


8. When we use width for text elements, need to use margin auto.


9. Media Query 

   - Media Queries allow to apply CSS styles depending on a device's general type.
   - To conditionally apply styles with the Css @media and @import rules 
   - How to use: @media <type> <feature>
   
   - Targeting media types: print, screen, hover, max-width, color
     


10. Code Refactoring

   - Readability
   - Modularity
   - Efficiently
   - Length


11. Multiple Selectors

   - Multiple classes: Group for a while two same classes as one css style. h1, p { color:red} in this case all of h1 and p elements will get a red color
   - Hierarchical Selectors: Group of id and class elements. #title .slider => in this case title and slider get a same value
   - Parent and child Selectors: .slider h1 {color: red} in this case h1 as child of slider class gets a red color
   
   - Combined Selectors: No space between of two selectors 
     1. selector1.selector2 {} => h1#title { color: red}, in this case h1 element that inside of title box gets red color
     2. selector1.#selector {} => p.slider { color: red}, in this case p element that inside of slider gets red color

     3. div.slider : will work no problem but div#title doesn't work
    
     4. element .class vs element.class 
        - element.class such as h1.title will change all h1 elements which have a title
