1. Bootstrap is super framework for used commonly responsive design

2. Rows and Column is super comfortable to use with
 
   - Row : default value is 100% of screen 
   - Col : default value is 100% of screen
   
   - col-lg: Large Column value as displayed in Large Laptops. col-lg-6(50% of 12), get 50% of screen 
   - col-md : For laptops
   - col-sm : For responsive mobile design


3. Order the style

   - when we have two css files such as style1.css and style2.css CSS styles are applied in the order they are linked in your HTML code.
     Unlike CSS and JavaScript, HTML code is executed from top to bottom so the order of your code matters.


4. Containers

   - Containers are fundamental building blocks of Bootstrap that contain, padding and align
   - Most basic layout element and required when using our default grid system.

   - Three different containers:
     1. .container : sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
     2. .container-fluid : which is width 100% of all breakpoints
     3. .container-{breakpoint} : which is width 100% until the specified breakpoint
     
       - container : { sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, fluid}
